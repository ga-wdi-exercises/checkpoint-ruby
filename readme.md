# Checkpoint: Ruby

## Before You Start

The test suite is located in `./spec`. **Before you begin anything, run `bundle install`.**

To run the tests in the terminal, run `rspec --format documentation`. Every time you make a change and save your files, you will need to manually re-run the tests. When you start, all of the tests will be failing; your goal is to make as many pass as you can in the hour provided.

> HINT: read the output of the failing tests.

## Instructions

This checkpoint is divided into three sections:

- Fundamentals in `fundamentals.rb`
- Enumerables in `enums.rb`
- Object Oriented Ruby in `oop.rb`

Each section has a series of prompts written in inline-comments. Write the Ruby necessary to complete each prompt.

**Make a commit after you complete each section.**
